# Sponsors &amp; Backers

CASL.js is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with its ongoing development made possible entirely thanks to the support of [my wife](https://github.com/Olena-Stotska), who allows me to spend our free time on Open Source :).
Maintaining and developing Open Source project takes considerable amount of time to:

* read, analyze and prioritize issues
* answer questions in support chat and stackoverflow
* create articles and examples of how to use CASL

So, I am currently exploring the possibility of working on CASL fulltime.

If you run a business and is using CASL in a revenue-generating product, it would make business sense to sponsor CASL development:
it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in the JavaScript community and makes it easier to attract JavaScript developers.

If you'd like to help and see how CASL evolves, please consider:
