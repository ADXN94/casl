# Sponsors &amp; Backers

CASL.js is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with its ongoing development made possible entirely thanks to the support of [my wife](https://github.com/Olena-Stotska), who allows me to spend our free time on Open Source :).
If you'd like CASL to evolve quicker, please consider:
